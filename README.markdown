# swayshot #

Print screen helper for [sway][] adds keyboard shortcuts for screenshots:

* **Print Scr** for whole screen
* **Alt + Print Scr** for a focused window
* **Shift + Print Scr** for a selected region

It saves screenshots to `XDG_PICTURES_DIR`, see more details on [XDG user directories][]

You can define your own screenshot folder: set **SWAYSHOT_SCREENSHOTS** in `~/.config/swayshot.sh`.

If `xsel` or `xclip` exist it copies full path to clipboard. Otherwise just prints it to `stdout`.

## How do I get set up?

### Archlinux

Just install the AUR package [swayshot][swayshot-AUR] â˜º

### Other Linux distributions

You need to copy files:

* `swayshot.config` copy to `/etc/sway/config.d` as `swayshot`;
* `swayshot.sh` copy to `/usr/bin` as `swayshot` and make it executable.
