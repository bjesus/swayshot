# swayshot #

Screenshot helper for [sway][].

It adds keyboard shortcuts to take screenshot:

-   **Print Scr** made screenshot for whole screen
-   **Alt + Print Scr** made screenshot for a focused window
-   **Shift + Print Scr** made screenshot for a selected region
-   **Super + Print Scr** made screenshot for whole screen then upload it to [x0.at][]
-   **Super + Alt + Print Scr** made screenshot for a focused window then upload it to [x0.at][]
-   **Super + Shift + Print Scr** made screenshot for a selected region then upload it to [x0.at][]

## Customization ##

It saves screenshots to **XDG_PICTURES_DIR** (usually `$HOME/Pictures`), see more details on [XDG user directories][].

Default template of screenshot filename is _screenshot_YYYY-MM-DD_HH24-MI-SS_SSS.png_. But you can change path and timestamp format

User variables in **~/.config/swayshot.sh**.

-   **SWAYSHOT_SCREENSHOTS** defines your own screenshot folder;
-   **SWAYSHOT_DATEFMT** defines timestamp format (see `man date`), thanks [Ranieri Althoff](https://gitlab.com/ranisalt) for help.

## Path to last screenshot ##

If **wl-clipboard** (wl-copy), **xsel** or **xclip** exist it copies full path to clipboard. Otherwise just prints it to **stdout**.

## How do I get set up?

### Archlinux

Just install the AUR package [swayshot][swayshot-AUR] â˜º

### Other Linux distributions

Requires:
-   grim
-   jq
-   slurp
-   sway (certainly)

Optional dependencies:
-   xsel
-   xclip
-   wl-clipboard

You need to copy files:

-   **swayshot.conf** copy to **/etc/sway/config.d**;
-   **swayshot.sh** copy to **/usr/bin** as **swayshot** and make it executable.

Then just reload Sway's configuration file (usually it's **$mod + Shift + c**).
